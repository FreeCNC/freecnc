0.3 - "The reckoning"
* New VFS (really)
* Fix 64bit issues
* Command line argument parsing
    First stage done, now need to migrate to new config object
* Phase in new GameEngine class (config, logger, vfs)
* ???
* Profit!

Unassigned, unsorted, incomplete:
* Music playlists
* Money tick looping speed.
* Moneycounter/buildqueue doesn't stop when mission is completed.
* Win32: Display gets corrupted if you alt-tab out. (Check if this still happens)
* Make grenades work properly
* Damage spreading beyond one tile
* Sound: Money change feedback sounds aren't looping fast enough.
* AI: capable of skirmishing and simple single player maps.
* Map loading: When reading in walls, attempt to locate any nearby
  buildings and use the owner of that building for the owner of the wall
  instead of always using the civilian side.
  Also work around maps that don't explicitly have the civilian
  side allied with the good guys.

* detect which version(s) of C&C you have, with a rudimentary way of
  selecting if a choice is available.
  This will remove the need to edit data/settings/freecnc.ini to run RA
* PlayerPool: non TD-specific types of player side.
* Prequisites, build queue: Very borken, will investigate later.
* other stuff of course.
* Further abstraction of TD/RA differences (e.g. filenames)

* Passenger/cargo code.  To be used for APCs et al, unit production (newly
  produced unit becomes the constructing building's cargo which is then
  ejected), harvesting, C4 demolitions, etc.

* Split common.h into several headers.
* Support for other WW games that used a similar engine (e.g. Dune2 and
  Dune2000).
