0.3 - "FreeCNC Forever"
* Some tiles next to rocks/trees are no longer passable, e.g. blocking the
  top of SCG01EA or right next to the tall rock in SCB01EA.
* Start refactoring sidebar, making it look proper

0.4
* Move the pointers to unit and structure over to shared_ptr and remove the
  refcounting.
* Remove code relating to various unimplemented features (replays and
  multiplayer)
* Fix non VFS related 64bit issues
* Rewrite INIFile to use Spirit and not allocate char buffers
* Rewrite the path finder
* Refactor sound engine
* Refactor input handling 

--- 

Unassigned, unsorted, incomplete:
* Video playback has been reported to deadlock on some systems (no details
  given, presumably dual core/proc).
* Music playlists
* Money tick looping speed.
* Moneycounter/buildqueue doesn't stop when mission is completed.
* Win32: Display gets corrupted if you alt-tab out. (Check if this still happens)
* Make grenades work properly
* Damage spreading beyond one tile
* Sound: Money change feedback sounds aren't looping fast enough.
* AI: capable of skirmishing and simple single player maps.
* Map loading: When reading in walls, attempt to locate any nearby
  buildings and use the owner of that building for the owner of the wall
  instead of always using the civilian side.
  Also work around maps that don't explicitly have the civilian
  side allied with the good guys.

* detect which version(s) of C&C you have, with a rudimentary way of
  selecting if a choice is available.
  This will remove the need to edit data/settings/freecnc.ini to run RA
* PlayerPool: non TD-specific types of player side.
* Prequisites, build queue: Very borken, will investigate later.
* other stuff of course.
* Further abstraction of TD/RA differences (e.g. filenames)

* Passenger/cargo code.  To be used for APCs et al, unit production (newly
  produced unit becomes the constructing building's cargo which is then
  ejected), harvesting, C4 demolitions, etc.

* Split common.h into several headers.
* Support for other WW games that used a similar engine (e.g. Dune2 and
  Dune2000).
